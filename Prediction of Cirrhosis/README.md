# Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes
This is an exercise from a Kaggle competition available in the link above: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e26

## Problem Description
The goal of this challenge is to predict the outcome of patients with cirrhosis. Since there are tree classes of outcomes the approach has to be by multiclass. The multi-class logarithm loss is the metric for evaluation. 

For this challenge I use tree machine learning models: Multinomial Log-Linear Model, Random Forest, and Xgboost.

The code was done in R, and the models were trained with the CARET package.
